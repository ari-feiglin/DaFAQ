# JOURNAL 
_Of the creation of the DaFAQ database system_ <br />
<br />

**CREATION** <br />
I began programming this on October 2, 2020.

**OCTOBER 5, 2020 - v0.0.0** <br />
v0.0.0 released. In it:

* The ability to create DaFAQ databases (using create_database to create and/or switch into the database directory and create_table to create a table)
* The ability to change data in the database (using switch_field to rename and/or change the datatype of a field and add_record to add a record)
* The ability to "poop" a table (print every record in the table)
